# Abstract
`Composite` is a structural design pattern, it lets you structure objects as tree through inheritance and composition. Then, you might work with objects as it was from the same class. 

For instance, if you have an Order which is composed from Product and sub-orders, every sub-orders may be a product or sub-order and you want to structure the global order in a easy way to calculate price, removing some elements or adding new ones.
